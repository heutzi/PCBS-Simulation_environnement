# PCBS-Simulation_environnement
Python project meant to provide a simulation of a natural environment. This project was written as a requirement for the course Programming for Cognitive and Brain Sciences (PCBS) taught by Mr. Pallier at the ENS. A good care was taken toward the reusability of the class framework, developed to structure the program.
